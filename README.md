# Trick Saber
*For Beat Saber v1.8*

This mod allows you to perform various tricks (like in Audica) with your sabers,
hence the name "Trick Saber".

```
For throwing the saber:
1) throw your controller (not literally)
2) hold the trigger button to release the saber
3) release the trigger button to pull the saber back to you
   (It does take a little bit of practice)

For rotating the saber in your hand:
for left saber : move your left thumbstick to the left
for right saber: move your right thumbstick to the right
```
